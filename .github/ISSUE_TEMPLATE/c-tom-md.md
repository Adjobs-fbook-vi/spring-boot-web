GitHub.com uses its own version of the Markdown syntax that provides an additional set of useful features, many of which make it easier to work with content on GitHub.com.

Note that some features of GitHub Flavored Markdown are only available in the descriptions and comments of Issues and Pull Requests. These include @mentions as well as references to SHA-1 hashes, Issues, and Pull Requests. Task Lists are also available in Gist comments and in Gist Markdown files.

Syntax highlighting

Here’s an example of how you can use syntax highlighting with GitHub Flavored Markdown:

```javascript function fancyAlert(arg) { if(arg) { $.facebox({div:'#foo'}) } } ``` 

You can also simply indent your code by four spaces:

function fancyAlert(arg) { if(arg) { $.facebox({div:'#foo'}) } } 

Here’s an example of Python code without syntax highlighting:

def foo(): if not bar: return True
